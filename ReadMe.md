# Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing datasets using Python, leveraging tools like Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It was designed to enhance my understanding of data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis.
_Literally a notebook of notebooks_

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

Data_Analysis/ <br>
    ├── .gitignore # Files and directories ignored by Git<br>
    ├── .venv/ # Virtual environment for dependency management (ignored by Git) <br>
    ├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies for the project <br>
    ├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for data analysis <br>
    ├── data/ # Datasets used in the analysis <br>
    └── src/ # Reusable Python scripts<br>


## Features
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Statistical Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Integration with Git and GitHub for version control

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
